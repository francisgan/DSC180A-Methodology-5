- Q: What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

Tools, chakra and astra-sim, turn the code into workload and generate workload timeline is interesting.

        
- Q: Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

Base on workload and timeline graph generated by tools, we will investigate what operation takes the most time and figure out potential improvement to accelerate the efficiency.

- Q: What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

Since we only care about the inference process, I will change the baseline code to version that can better simulate the inference part.


- Q: What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I would like to learn Docker, Since we are using multiple open-source project. It will be convinient for us to test and pack our final outcome.
